					<h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
					<br>

					<p>It is LizardByte's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while
						operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to
						<a href="https://app.lizardbyte.dev">https://app.lizardbyte.dev</a>
						(hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://app.lizardbyte.dev"). We respect your privacy and are
						committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the
						Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may
						be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may
						disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we
						collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other
						sources.</p>
					<p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms of service posted on our Website, set forth the
						general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when
						visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms of service.</p>
					<br>

					<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
					<p>Like most website operators, LizardByte collects non-personally-identifying information of the
						sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
						, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. LizardByte's purpose in
						collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how LizardByte's
						visitors use its website. From time to time, LizardByte may release non-personally-identifying
						information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its
						website.</p>
					<p>LizardByte also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
						(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://app.lizardbyte.dev
						blog posts. LizardByte only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
						circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described
						below.</p>
					<br>

					<h2>Security</h2>
					<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
						transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive
						to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee
						its absolute security.</p>
					<br>

					<h2>Advertisements</h2>
					<p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set
						cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you
						an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This
						information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that
						they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by
						LizardByte and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
					<br>

					<h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
					<p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a
						third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to
						review the Privacy Policy and terms of service of every site you visit.</p>
					<p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or
						practices of any third party sites, products or services.</p>
					<br>

					<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
					<p>LizardByte may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. LizardByte may
						display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, LizardByte does not
						disclose your personally-identifying information.</p>
					<br>

					<h2>Cookies</h2>
					<p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, LizardByte uses "Cookies", similar technologies
						and services provided by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and
						store your preferences on your computer.</p>
					<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the
						visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. LizardByte uses
						cookies to help LizardByte identify and track visitors, their usage of
						https://app.lizardbyte.dev, and their website access preferences. LizardByte visitors who do
						not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies
						before using LizardByte's websites, with the drawback that certain features of LizardByte's
						websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
					<p>By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby
						acknowledge and agree to LizardByte's use of cookies.</p>
					<br>

					<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
					<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, LizardByte may change its Privacy Policy from time
						to time, and in LizardByte's sole discretion. LizardByte encourages visitors to frequently
						check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after
						any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
